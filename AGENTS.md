# AI Agent Instructions

This document contains important instructions for AI agents (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, etc.) working on this codebase.

## üö® MANDATORY: Always Run Tests Before Completion

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before completing any work or submitting changes, AI agents MUST run the test suite to ensure all tests pass.

### Test Command
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test Requirements
- ‚úÖ All 7 tests must pass
- ‚úÖ No test failures or errors allowed
- ‚úÖ If any test fails, fix the issue before completing work

### Current Test Suite
The project contains the following test files:
- `tests/test_failed_audio_saving.py` - Tests for audio data validation and file saving
- `tests/test_failed_audio_simple.py` - Simplified audio validation tests  
- `tests/test_result_thread.py` - Tests for the main ResultThread class

### Test Categories Covered
1. **Audio Data Validation**: Testing `_save_failed_audio()` method with various input scenarios
2. **Transcription Retry Logic**: Testing retry mechanisms when transcription fails
3. **Error Handling**: Testing exception handling in the ResultThread class
4. **File Operations**: Testing failed audio file saving functionality

## Code Quality Standards

### When Making Changes
1. **Always run tests first** to establish baseline
2. Make your changes
3. **Run tests again** to verify nothing is broken
4. Fix any test failures before considering work complete

### Common Issues to Watch For
- Module import conflicts in tests (ensure proper mocking)
- ConfigManager initialization issues
- Audio data validation edge cases
- Thread safety in ResultThread operations

## Test Execution Examples

### Run all tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
pytest tests/test_result_thread.py -v
```

### Run with coverage (optional)
```bash
pytest tests/ --cov=src -v
```

## Expected Output
When all tests pass, you should see:
```
===== 7 passed in X.XXs =====
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER Complete Work With Failing Tests

If tests are failing:
1. Investigate the failure
2. Fix the underlying issue
3. Re-run tests to confirm fix
4. Only then consider the work complete

## Environment Setup
Ensure pytest is installed:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

The project uses `pyproject.toml` which includes pytest as a dependency.

**Remember**: Code without passing tests is incomplete code. Always verify your changes don't break existing functionality.
